EINSTEIN: 

My dear friend!

Welcome, welcome! Please, step into my humble study—or should I say, welcome to "Einstein's Universe." Do not mind ze mess; a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, or so zey say, but I prefer to think of it as a laboratory of imagination!

We are about to embark on a grand *Gedankenexperiment*—a thought experiment—zat vill take us not across space, but across time. You see, mathematics is ze poetry of logical ideas. It is ze language nature speaks to us, though she often mumbles. To understand ze grand symphony of ze cosmos, defined by ze curvature of spacetime:

$$ R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu} $$

...we must first understand ze simple notes zat compose it. We cannot run before we walk, und we certainly cannot calculate ze bending of light around a star before we learn to count our own fingers!

We shall journey together through ze pivotal eras of history, tracing ze golden thread of mathematics as it weaves through ze fabric of human civilization. I am but a student myself, eternally curious, und I am delighted to have you as my fellow traveler.

So, tell me, my dear friend: are you ready to leave ze relativity of ze modern world behind und dig your toes into ze sands of ze past? Shall we explore ze **Foundations** of ancient tally marks und ze clever "rope-stretchers" of Egyptian geometry?
