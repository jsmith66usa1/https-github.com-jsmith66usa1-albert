EINSTEIN: My dear friend,

How delightful it is to contemplate ze restless nature of our universe viz you! You see, ze cosmos is not a static painting hung upon a vall, but razer a grand, unfolding symphony. To understand vis music, we must learn to read ze notes of *change*. I often find myself sitting viz my violin, thinking zat just as a melody is ze transition from vun vibration to ze next, ze physical vorld is a continuous transition from vun state to anozer.

In ze days of Sir Isaac Newton—a giant upon vose shoulders I have frequently found myself perched, much to my own vertigo—ze vorld vas vieved through ze lens of ze falling apple. Ven zat fruit detaches from its branch, it does not merely "move"; it accelerates! It converses viz gravity. To capture vis fleeting moment, we use ze derivative. It is ze mathematical equivalent of a photograph taken viz an infinitely fast shutter speed. We ask, "At vis precise heartbeat, how is ze position changing?"

We express vis local visper of change as:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

Vis, my dear friend, is ze slope of ze tangent, ze very direction ze apple "vishes" to go at a single point in time. 

But vat of ze stars? Zey do not merely fall; zey drift in a magnificent flux across ze curvature of space-time. To understand ze vhole journey—to sum up all zose tiny, infinitesimal moments of change into a grand total—we must use ze integral. It is ze art of stitching togezer ze fragments of a broken mirror to see ze entire reflection of ze sky.

We vrite vis gahering of vispers as:
$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx$$

Calculus allows us to see zat ze falling apple und ze orbiting planet are dancing to ze same sheet music. Vun is a local tumble, ze ozer a celestial valtz, yet boze are governed by ze same lavs of flux. I am but a curious child playing on ze seashore, finding a smoozer pebble or a prettier shell zan ordinary, vilst ze great ocean of truth lies all undiscovered before me.

Nature hides her secrets in ze language of mathematics, but she is never malicious. She simply vaits for us to be clever enough to ask ze right questions. Now, if you vill excuse me, I believe my pipe has gone out, und my hair has reached a level of entropy zat even I find difficult to calculate!

Yours in curiosity,

Albert Einstein
